# Remote-first Test
## Motivation
Remote work has been rising for years. World-wide Internet penetration paired with mature communication and collaborating tools led us there. Most companies have remote employees/freelancers, some to a greater and some to a lesser extent.

The Remote-First Test assesses if a company is remote-first or at least remote-friendly. Remote-first goes further than remote-friendly meaning the entire company's processes are designed for remote work, wether individual team members are remote or not.

## Questions

1. Do all employees/freelancers have good English skills?
2. Do all employees/freelancers have good Internet connections for video calls (min. 1 Mbit/s upload, max. 50ms ping)?
3. Are video calls and group video calls the standard for synchronous communication?
4. Are chats and group chats the standard for asynchronous communication?
5. Are mixed meetings with remote and non-remote participants always held as a group video call where every particpant uses their own video call client?
6. Do departments/project teams hold short daily group video calls?
7. Are all company workflows and communications properly managed and documented in appropriate systems?
8. Are more than half of all contributors remote?
9. Is the entire company communication held in English?
10. Does the company do yearly team retreats?

## Questions + Explanations

### Do all employees/freelancers have good English skills?
Hiring remote workers is great because a company can choose from a much larger talent pool than just from the origin country. Hence, this test assumes that a remote-first company hires on a world-wide level and then, English is the franca lingua.

To be productive in a remote team it's essential that every team has good or very good verbal and written English skills. At the end of the day, work is about collaboration and collaboration is about communication. If just one team member has less than average English overall team productivity suffers.

### Do all employees/freelancers have good Internet connections for video calls (min. 1 Mbit/s upload, max. 50ms ping)?
As important as good English skills is the everyone's ability to stream crisp and clear video. If just one particpant in a group video call has a bad Internet connectivty the entire team's communication, motivation and productivity suffers.

### Are video calls and group video calls the standard for synchronous communication?
Video calls are quite close to a real face-to-face interaction plus they allow screen sharing, so they should employed whenever a synchronous communication is need and preferred over voice calls.

### Are chats and group chats the standard for asynchronous communication?
Chats are a mixed bag. Too much is distracting and throws people out of their flow and too little makes the team feel not present. At the end, it's important that any team member can contact any team member on relevant topics via chat and responses come in a timely manner (in everyone's working time). This make a remote team being perceived lively and vibrant.

### Are mixed meetings with remote and non-remote participants always held as a group video call where every particpant uses their own video call client?
Even if remote workers are the minority in a meeting, it is crucial that the meeting is always held a pure video call where everyone is in front of their own video call device (e.g., notebook). Remote workers shouldn't be connected through a video conferencing solution to a meeting room where all the non-remote participants have a real face-2-face meeting. This would lead to situation where the non-remote participants have an advantage and overall communication quality uffers.

### Do departments/project teams hold short daily group video calls?
Daily group video calls help to understand better topics related to the own work field and also get to know other team members. It creates the feeling that there is a real company and community to which every individual belongs to. These meetings should kept short (five to ten minutes).

### Are all company workflows and communications properly managed and documented in appropriate systems?
For remote team it's not possible to go to a meeting room and sketch some ideas on a whiteboard. So, communication must always be crystal clear, unambiguous and easy accessible. This means that every communication must be documentated in appropriate systems, e.g. project management in Trello, group chats in Slack, specifications in Google Doc, etc.

### Are more than half of all employees/freelancers remote?
If just a minority of a company works remotely all company workflows and process are rather designed for non-remote work. Remote worker feel like second-class citizens in such an environment.

### Is the entire company communication held in English?
This question relates to the first one and tackles the problem that sometimes groups tend to switch to their native non-English language to clarify matters. This may happen but creates a feeling of being again second-class citizen.

### Does the company do yearly team retreats?
This is obviously and need if a company wants to strengthen the identification of every individal with the company and its people.
