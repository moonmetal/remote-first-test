# Remote-first Test
## Motivation
Remote work has been rising for years. World-wide Internet penetration paired with mature communication and collaborating tools led us there. Most companies have remote employees/freelancers, some to a greater and some to a lesser extent.

The Remote-First Test assesses if a company is remote-first or at least remote-friendly. Remote-first goes further than remote-friendly meaning the entire company's processes are designed for remote work, wether individual team members are remote or not.

## Questions

1. Do all employees/freelancers have good English skills?
2. Do all employees/freelancers have good Internet connections for video calls (min. 1 Mbit/s upload, max. 50ms ping)?
3. Are video calls and group video calls the standard for synchronous communication?
4. Are chats and group chats the standard for asynchronous communication?
5. Are mixed meetings with remote and non-remote participants always held as a group video call where every particpant uses their own video call client?
6. Do departments/project teams hold short daily group video calls?
7. Are all company workflow and communications properly managed and documented in appropriate systems?
8. Are more than half of all contributors remote?
9. Is the entire company communication held in English?
10. Does the company do yearly team retreats?

## Questions + Explanations

### Do all employees/freelancers have good English skills?
Hiring remote workers is great because a company can choose from a much larger talent pool than just from the origin country. Hence, this test assumes that a remote-first company hires on a world-wide level and English is the franca lingua.

To be productive in a remote team it's essential that every team has good or very good verbal and written English skills. At the end of the day, work is about collaboration and collaboration is about communication. If just one team member has less than average English overall team productivity suffers.

### Do all employees/freelancers have good Internet connections for video calls (min. 1 Mbit/s upload, max. 50ms ping)?
As important as good English skills is the everyone's ability to stream crisp and clear video. If just one particpant in a group video call has a bad Internet connectivty the entire team's communication, motivation and productivity suffers.
